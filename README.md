# FlightManagement
This is a simulation of an Flight management system. The front end is written in **HTML** and **CSS** and the back end is written in **PHP**.
## How to set up the environment?
Since this is just a simulation, there is no real database right now. So we need to download a software that will simulate the local machine as a database. The name is XAMPP.
